== Note == 
Our C++ version is currently under development, but we hope to release an Alpha version of the software soon.  
You can access our pre-Alpha version here: https://github.com/OpenPIV/openpiv-c--qt.  



== Installation on Linux ==

To compile the program you will need the following libraries (make sure to get the *developer* versions):

- qt4
- fftw3
- libtiff4

In the source directory you need to run 'qmake' (or something like 'qmake-qt4', depending on how your distro works), 
followed by 'make'. 

If somebody is interested in contributing to the development, we would be more than happy to find a project.
